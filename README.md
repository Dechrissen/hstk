_Headline Snap database, scripts, and tools_

This project contains a local database of Headline Snaps as text, command-line tools to interface with the database, as well as various OCR scripts used to convert the original raw Headline Snap image files into text. There also exists a pipeline that can be invoked to add _new_ Headline Snaps into the database, after which the remote repository should be updated.
